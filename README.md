## Introduction

The Update Framework (TUF) is a robust framework for secure content delivery and updates. It safeguards against various types of supply chain attacks and ensures resilience to compromise.

## About The Update Framework

The Update Framework (TUF) is a design that helps developers maintain the security of a software update system, even against attackers that compromise the repository or signing keys. TUF provides a flexible specification defining functionality that developers can use in any software update system or re-implement to fit their needs.

TUF is hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as part of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF) and is utilized in production by various tech companies and open-source organizations. A variant of TUF called [Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/) is used to secure over-the-air updates in automobiles.

For more information about TUF, visit [TUF's website](https://theupdateframework.com/).
